# system-essays

This repository contains a small collection of system-level analytical essays.

These essays aim to make structural dynamics legible: how incentives, constraints, and feedback loops interact, and why certain large-scale systems fail to self-correct despite attention, effort, or reform.

The primary mode is diagnostic. Some essays may also include context-specific prescriptions or design suggestions.

They are not frameworks, methodologies, or reusable toolkits.
